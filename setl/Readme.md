#File Description
1. *materialmine_ontology.setl.ttl* file creates the materialsnmine ontology
2. *materialsmine.ttl* is the generated materialsmine ontology
3. *materialsmine_kg.setl.ttl* file ingests the metamine data in the Knowledge graph (currently the metamine protion consists of static 2-D data from Caltech)
4. *materialsmine_kg.ttl* is the sample output file of the ingested data in the knowledge graph. The actual data is in the trig output format, and since it is a very large file and we typical avoid storing the knowledge graph files on github hence, a sample output file in the turtle format is presented here.
