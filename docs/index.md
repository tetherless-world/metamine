<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
> <p align="justify"> MetaMine Ontology is created to provide structure to the available structural metamaterials. We also demonstrate how a knowledge graph could be created using our ontology and provide our ontologies applications in and outside structural metamaterial domian. This website demonstrates few of the many capabilities (reusability and extensibility) of our ontology and the vision of semantics being the backbone of materials science. This could be executed by connecting a knowledge graph of all the available materials science ontologies and knowledge graphs as shown in our paper. </p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
> <p align="justify">Metamaterials is a multidisciplinary domain. They enable extreme miniaturization and can be customized to support novel properties that are currently not accessible, leading to entirely new systems. Moreover, they are created by changing the geometry of currently available materials, which leads to multiple challenges for representing various geometries based on symmetries, dimensionalities and type of data. Metamaterials, as comparatively the newest field in the materials science domain, lacks a common data representation and a repository which could hold all the different metamaterials and help scientists discover new advanced metamaterials. We also provide a knowledge graph template and semantic extract, transform, and load-r scripts as a guide for ingesting data in a knowledge graph, which gets its structure using our Metamine Ontology. A set of SPARQL queries is also provided as a stepping stone which allows researchers to extract knowledge from the created knowledge graph. All this is available on our resource website with a tutorial. We continue to provide a vision of a knowledge graph of materials science ontologies similar to BioPortal using our ontology concepts to provide a rich platform for researchers. </p>

<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
> <p align="justify">We thank all the members of the Metamine Project, names from Duke, names from UVM, names from Caltech, names from Northwestern, who enlightened me about the domain, its issues and the problem that they are looking to solve. They also helped us to understand the domain outside the structural metamaterials which helped us to find its applications and evaluate MO's extensibility and reusability. We also thank our colleagues from RPI, Henrique Santos, Shruthi Chari and Rebecca Cowan, who provided insight and expertise that greatly assisted with this publication.</p>
